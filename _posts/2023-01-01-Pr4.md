# Task Describtion
Developing multi-channel preprocessing technology for noisy and echo-prone kiosk environments, focusing on echo cancellation and beamforming techniques.
<br/>

## Background
In noisy and echo-laden environments like kiosks, it is difficult to accurately process speech signals for proper recognition and direction detection.
<br/>

## Proposed Solution
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <img src="../assets/img/work/pr4_arch.png" alt="Image 1" style="width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin-right: 2%;">
</div>
* System: Created an integrated system that combines echo cancellation, reverberation removal, and mask-based beamforming.
* Echo Cancellation: Implemented a Weighted Prediction Error (WPE) algorithm for multi-channel echo cancellation.
* Beamforming: Applied a Coherence-to-Diffuse Ratio (CDR) mask for beamforming to enhance directional signal processing.
<br/>

# Outcome

The system is currently under development with collaboration from NCSoft, focusing on deployment in kiosk environments.
<br/>

# My Contributions
* Developed the echo cancellation and beamforming algorithms.
* Ported the system to C++ for deployment in real-world kiosk environments.
