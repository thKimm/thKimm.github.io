# Task Describtion
Developing a direction detection system for single-source audio in extreme noise environments, designed for robot vacuums equipped with multiple microphones.
<br/>

## Background
In noisy environments, especially in hardware-constrained robot vacuums, it is challenging to accurately detect the direction of a single audio source while reducing noise in real-time.
<br/>

## Proposed Solution
* System: Designed an integrated system that efficiently combines noise reduction and direction detection algorithms in real-time.
* Noise Reduction Module: Developed a lightweight noise reduction model (Tiny Recurrent U-Net) optimized for low-latency real-time operation on limited hardware.
* Source Localization Module: Enhanced direction detection by utilizing the output of the noise reduction module, applying a Signal-to-Noise Ratio mask and Recursive Least Squares for noise estimation.
