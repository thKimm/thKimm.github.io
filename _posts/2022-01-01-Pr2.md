# Task Describtion
Development of a system that transcribes meeting minutes in real-time by using speaker diarization and voice recognition technologies.
<br/>

## Background
The challenge was to accurately separate speakers and transcribe meeting minutes in real-time with minimal errors while managing large amounts of speech data.
<br/>

## Proposed Solution
* System: Developed an efficient process integrating speech separation, speaker diarization, and speech recognition technologies.
* Speaker Diarization System: Created a speaker diarization system based on speaker embeddings and rule-based logic for speaker separation.
* Meeting Minutes Generation: Designed a system that integrates separated speaker audio and transcription results to create meeting minutes automatically.
