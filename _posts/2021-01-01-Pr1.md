# Task Describtion
Development of a website that **provides a Korean TTS model**, focusing on both the back-end TTS model integration and the front-end website development.
<br/>

## Background
There was a need to efficiently integrate a TTS model with a website while minimizing latency and ensuring smooth communication between the server and the client.
<br/>

## Proposed Solution
* System: Designed an efficient connection between the Edge and Server for real-time TTS model operation.
* Edge: Created a website that minimizes latency for text input and speech output.
* Server: Developed and implemented a Korean TTS model with proper pre-processing for better performance.
