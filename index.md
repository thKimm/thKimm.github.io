# About Me

# About Me

Welcome to my page!

Iâ€™m Taehan Kim, a passionate researcher with a focus on audio preprocessing and its many applications, especially in the realm of speech. 

Over the years, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working on a variety of exciting projects, including TTS (Text-to-Speech), Speaker Diarization, Speech Enhancement/Separation, and embedding speech processing modules into robots. Currently, my research is centered around Speech Enhancement (offline model, online model, lightweight model for embedded systems), Speech Separation (achieving SOTA results, generalizing for more than two speakers, online models), and personalized Speech Processing.
But beyond these, Iâ€™m always eager to explore new challenges and push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.

I previously majored in Electronic Engineering at Sogang University in Seoul.
I also interned at the [Intelligent Information Processing Lab](http://iip.sogang.ac.kr) (Prof. Hyung-min Park) within the Department of Electronic Engineering. Now, Iâ€™m continuing my journey as a masterâ€™s student in the same lab.

I love to connect with others who share my interests or simply want to chat about the latest in tech. Feel free to reach out!

#### ðŸ’¡**New!** 

Iâ€™m also a Visiting Research Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University, where Iâ€™m continuing to broaden my horizons and collaborate with brilliant minds in the field.
