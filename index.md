# About Me

Welcome to my page!

Iâ€™m Taehan Kim, a passionate researcher with a focus on audio preprocessing and its many applications, especially in the realm of speech. 

Over the years, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working on a variety of exciting projects, including TTS (Text-to-Speech), Speaker Diarization, Speech Enhancement/Separation, and embedding speech processing modules into robots. <br>Currently, my research is centered around **Speech Enhancement (Universal model, Online/Lightweight model for embedded systems), Speech Separation (achieving SOTA results, generalizing for more than two speakers, online models), and personalized Speech Processing**.<br>
But beyond these, Iâ€™m always eager to explore new challenges and push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.

I previously majored in Electronic Engineering at Sogang University in Seoul, **graduating as the top student of the School of Engineering department.**(GPA: 4.21/4.3, 134 credits in 7 semesters)
<br>I also interned at the [Intelligent Information Processing Lab](http://iip.sogang.ac.kr) (Prof. Hyung-min Park) within the Department of Electronic Engineering. Now, Iâ€™m continuing my journey as a masterâ€™s student in the same lab.

I love to connect with others who share my interests or simply want to chat about the latest in tech. Feel free to reach out!

#### ðŸ’¡**New!** 

Iâ€™m also a Visiting Research Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University, where Iâ€™m continuing to broaden my horizons and collaborate with brilliant minds in the field.
